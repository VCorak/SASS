# Title: SASS 

- Repository: `sass`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning Challenge`

## Learning objectives
- [ ] What is a CSS-Preprocessor is
- [ ] Generate some CSS from your CSS preprocessor (SASS)
[ ] Being able to minify your CSS output
- Knowledge of the following SASS features:
  - [ ] Variables
  - [ ] Mixins (Functions)
  - [ ] Nesting
  - [ ] Partials & Import
  - [ ] Extend/Inheritance
  - [ ] Operators (Math)

## The Mission
- [x] Learn more about SASS with the included index.html file and some helpful videos like:

- [x] Install Sass with the instructions found on https://sass-lang.com/install

- [x] After the installation type `sass -v` in the console, it should display the latest version.

I am using Phpstorm, the moment you create a .scss file, it will offer you to manage SASS compilation for you, you can accept this. In PHPSTORM this is called a file watcher, you can always edit the settings in `file -> settings -> file watcher -> scss`.


## Must-have features

Mission is to rewrite the example.css to a scss file with the following changes:

### Part 1
- [x] Make one mixin for the 3 lines of the box-shadow styling.

- [x] Make the general padding the same everywhere with one variable. (red=16px, blue=8px), the footer h6 should have double the padding of the other elements. Use "operations" to do this. Do NOT hardcode the padding inside your scss. 

- [x] Nest the styling rules of grouped elements, like the sections in the Article.

- [x] Make use of extend to re-use the same CSS for the "success", "error" and "warning" messages.

### Part 2 - the tricky part!
- [ ] In the HTML, add 2 links called "blue" & "red".
- [ ] Clicking one of the 2 links should change the text to red/blue with a good matching background (keep it readable)!
All the other CSS should be the same, to do this combine SASS variables with file imports.

Take some time to think how to do the structure of this exercise, and how many files you will need. It might be good to discuss this with your fellow juniors!

### Part 3 (optional)
- Add an option to your compilation to minify your stylesheet!
Mine was below 1.6k, can you do better? Do you still remember the option to `ls` to make the filesize Human readable?
